	so you as our customer get nothing but the best. Our Coffee is freshly ground for you, so you don't have to grind the beans yourself. Beans designated for espresso are roasted longer
	than regular coffee beans, so that the oils are brought to the surface of the bean. So come on down and give our coffee a 
	try!</em>
